# CRM Control App - WIP

This project is a simple CRM for **anyone** where the user (administrator) can administrate his clients.

I'm using a json-server typicode for hosting the API. So any modification of the web values won't be applied, but it's enough to visualize the main purpose.

You can visualize this [here](https://reliable-valkyrie-b34511.netlify.app/clientes)

Run this web:
- To run this web you have to deploy a json-server with: **json-server --watch db.json --port 4000**  in your terminal (You must to have installed it before).
- In your IDE or Text Editor you can run the web with: **npm run dev** in the project terminal.
